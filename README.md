# keyper
a key(password) management program

  So far, this work is just started. no code has been written.

  The final target is that user could remember only one password which used 
for identity authentication and his accounts and corresponding keys are en-
crpt by symmetric or asymmetric key. So once the identity authentication is
passed, user can get any of the accounts and keys decrypted.
  
  Why I do this? Because many people including me just use one or two pass-
words for their all accounts, however, many hit library events have been r-
eported, so it's a very bad habit doing so. But there is an embarrasing fact
that we can't remember one complex key for each account, thus these keys sh-
ould be saved somewhere and in ciphertext. This process did add user's time
to access his account, but it's safer.
